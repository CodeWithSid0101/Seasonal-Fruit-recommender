Its horticultural significance lies in being one of Asia's largest wholesale and consumption markets, with produce arriving from all over India. The fruits locally available are primarily sourced from its immediate agricultural hinterland in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, reflecting the produce of the North Indian plains.",
